# Fraud-Detection-Random-Forest-Logistic-Regression
Machine learning project for detecting credit card fraud using Random Forest and Logistic Regression

# Credit Card Fraud Detection
A Python project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

## Features
- Handles imbalanced classes (SMOTE, under-sampling, class weighting)
- Baseline and tuned models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV
- Model evaluation with ROC and Precision-Recall curves
- Feature interpretability using SHAP and logistic regression coefficients

## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies:

# Credit Card Fraud Dataset
This project uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

## How to download
1. Create a Kaggle account.
2. Install Kaggle API: `pip install kaggle`
3. Run: `kaggle datasets download -d mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud`
4. Place `creditcard.csv` in this `data/` folder.
